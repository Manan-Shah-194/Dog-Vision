Dog Vision is a deep learning project designed to classify dog breeds from images using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Built using TensorFlow and Keras, this project demonstrates end-to-end image classification workflow on a dataset of dog images.

üî• Features
Image Preprocessing:

Automatic image resizing, scaling, and normalization.

Data augmentation (random flips, rotations, zoom) to improve model generalization.

CNN Model Architecture:

Multiple convolutional and pooling layers for feature extraction.

Dense layers with dropout for classification.

Flexible to modify and experiment with different architectures.

Training & Evaluation:

Supports model training on GPU (if available).

Displays loss and accuracy metrics.

Visualizes training curves for easy monitoring.

Prediction Functionality:

Predict the breed of a new dog image.

Outputs confidence scores.

Visualization:

Shows example images from dataset.

Displays prediction results with images and probabilities.

‚öôÔ∏è Tech Stack
Language: Python

TensorFlow / Keras

NumPy

Matplotlib

PIL (Python Imaging Library)

üíª How to Use
1Ô∏è‚É£ Clone the repository or download the notebook.
2Ô∏è‚É£ Prepare your dog images dataset and adjust paths as needed.
3Ô∏è‚É£ Run the notebook cells step by step:

Load and preprocess images.

Train the CNN model.

Evaluate and visualize results.

Use the prediction function to classify new dog images.

üéØ Dataset
Works with any image dataset structured into subfolders (one per breed).

Can be adapted for datasets like Stanford Dogs Dataset or custom labeled images.

üöÄ Future Improvements
Use transfer learning with pretrained models (e.g., ResNet, MobileNet) for better accuracy.

Add support for more dog breeds and larger datasets.

Deploy as a web app (e.g., using Streamlit or Flask).
